            <p>This was the very last movie I watched in the "Before Times" pre-pandemic. A French lesbian-romance film set in 1700s Italy, it combines a lot of my favorite things into one ideal package: Gay romance, historical settings, and 'arthouse' style directing. Extremely emotional and heartfelt, despite how much I cried into my girlfriend's arms after the movie I did love just about everything about it. Combining classic literature and mythology in a refreshing slow burn romance that is filled with anxiety and angst.</p>

            <p>Another one of the last films I watched in a pre-pandemic world back in early February. An animated Japanese film by critically acclaimed director Makoto Shinkai. Delightful animation and a standout soundtrack help bounce along a story about a woman who can control the weather. Held on it's own merit is an extremely good film but it's major falling is that it hits every single beat Shinkai's previous and most famous work "Your Name" already has, feeling like a rehash of familiar ground.</p>

            <p>A recent watch this year for me and one I had been meaning to get to for a very long time. Considered to be one of Bong Joon-ho's first "classics" Memories of Murder is a fictional story revolving around the real mysterty of the Korean Zodiac Killer. Despite being from 2003 the film feels extremely modern with Joon-ho's clever use of tonal shifts, expectation subversion, and fantastic editing makes the two hour runtime fly by. Desptie being set around real historical events the story crafts out an extremelt heartfelt and emotional story that is a joy to experience. </p>

            <p>A horror movie that is so much more than it initally reveals itself to be. Watching this was actually a rewatch for me but watching it during quarantine put a completely different feeling to the film than when I had first watched it. Kiyoshi Kurosawa weaves a story of ghosts in a new modern age, using the basis of a ghost story to show how the distance between others begins to grow in an age where the internet allows people to live dual lives. Despite being close to one another we all live in true isolation, even if we are never able to ever truly understand one another the truth to our connections is our willingness to leap past that gap.</p>

            <p>Another rewatch on the list for me but one that I had watched so long ago I doubt anything about the film actually stuck with me as it did on this watch. A mind bending and stylish horror film from the master Dario Argento centering around an Italian ballet school that houses a dark secret. With standout cinemtography and set design the film almost feels like a dream or a fairy tale as the nightmarish truth slowly unveils itself across the runtime. Notably the film influenced George A. Romero with it's use of color and the Japanese director Kunnihiko Ikuhara, both building off the film's use of color and style in their sets.</p>

            <h2>Tetsuo: The Iron Man</h2>
            <img src="https://i.mydramalist.com/6vDxWf.jpg" width="400" height="600" alt="Movie poster">
            <p>Very recently watched this film and you know what I don't even know what to say. A black and white cyberpunk film about a man slowly turning into a machine over the course of the film's one hour runtime. Harkens back to early 60s and 70s exploitation films with outrageous visuals, an incredible soundtrack, and stopmotion body horror effects. Honestly this is probably the strangest film I've ever seen in my life, my girlfriend and roommate where both really mad at me for picking this movie for for movie night.</p>
